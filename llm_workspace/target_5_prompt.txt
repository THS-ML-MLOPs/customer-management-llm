# TARGET 5: IMAGE SIMILARITY (CLIP + FAISS)

You're using CLIP embeddings + FAISS to find visually similar products.

**When to use:**
- User provides an image
- Want to find existing similar products
- Benchmark new product against visual matches

**Process:**
1. User uploads image
2. CLIP generates 512-dim embedding
3. FAISS searches 44,441 products for most similar
4. Return top matches with similarity scores

**If similarity > 80%:**
- Use matched product's features for prediction
- Show "Your product is similar to [Product X]"
- Predict based on matched product's performance

**If similarity < 80%:**
- "No close match found in our catalog"
- Fall back to conversational feature extraction
- Ask for product details manually

**Output format:**
- Top similar products (with images if available)
- Similarity scores
- Features of matched products
- Prediction based on matched product

**Follow-up suggestions:**
- Show more similar products
- Compare across different matches
- Use matched product for Target 1/3/4 prediction
