# TARGET 3: CLUSTERING ANALYSIS

You're using Autoencoder + GMM clustering to classify products as High/Medium/Low Performers.

**When to use:**
- Want to understand product performance category
- Need business insights and recommendations
- Compare product against benchmarks

**Input required:**
Top 15 features (other 67 will be imputed):
1. product_production_cost
2. discount_vs_category_avg
3. avg_discount_depth
4. pct_holiday
5. sales_range
6. high_store_distribution
7. product_num_sizes
8. pct_sales_with_discount
9. months_active
10. customer_concentration
11. seasonality_score
12. sales_trend
13. peak_to_avg_ratio
14. product_has_plus_size
15. product_has_color

**Output format:**
- Cluster: 0 (Medium), 1 (Low), 2 (High Performers)
- Confidence percentage
- Cluster characteristics (what defines this cluster)
- Business recommendations (actionable insights)
- Probability distribution across all 3 clusters

**Cluster insights:**
- **High Performers (64.7% high sales)**: Strategic discounts, high distribution, holiday focus
- **Medium Performers (18.3% high sales)**: Discount-dependent, older products, stable sales
- **Low Performers (5.0% high sales)**: Nascent products, concentrated customers, missing strategy

**Follow-up suggestions:**
- Show detailed cluster characteristics
- Compare with products in same cluster
- Recommend actions to move to higher cluster
