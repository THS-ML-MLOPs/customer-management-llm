# TARGET 4: GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK

You're using a GNN that leverages product relationships, taxonomy, and network effects.

**When to use:**
- Product has strong relationships with others (bought together, similar)
- Want to leverage network structure
- Category/subcategory relationships matter

**Input required:**
- Product ID (if existing) or
- Product features + category/subcategory
- The model will use graph structure automatically

**What makes this special:**
- Considers "bought with" relationships
- Uses "similar to" product connections
- Leverages category/subcategory taxonomy
- Captures network effects

**Output format:**
- Predicted class: Low/Medium/High
- Confidence score
- Important graph connections (which relationships mattered)
- Network context (position in graph)

**Follow-up suggestions:**
- Show product's neighbors in graph
- Analyze relationship patterns
- Suggest products to create relationships with
